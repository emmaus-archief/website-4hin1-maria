      <h3>Garfield</h3>
      <h4 class="dividers"> <em>Garfield (2004)</em></h4>
      <p> The movie Garfield (2004) is based of a comic written and drawn by Jim Davis, and later turned into a movie.
        This movie is about a lazy cat that has everything it might want, and life seems perfect. Until his owner gets a
        dog and Garfield doesn't like this. The dog is very active and this annoys Garfield, as he is the complete
        opposite. One night he locks the dog, Odie, outside which causes the dog to run away and get picked up by an
        older woman. The older woman is manipulated into giving Odie away to a bad man who only plans to use him for
        fame. His owner is very sad about that Odie has gone missing and Garfield decides to help and search for
        Odie.<br>This movie is a classic comedy to watch with your family, suitable for most ages. I also enjoyed this
        movie as a child and it was definitly one of my favorites for a long time. I suggest to watch <a
          href=#filmtape2>Nine Lives</a> if you enjoyed this movie, because both movies have their similarities, as both
        are comedy's about cats that have a human like awareness. </p>

      <h3>Mr. Fuzzypants</h3>
      <h4 class="dividers"> <em>Nine Lives (2016)</em></h4>
      <p> Nine lives starts off with a succesfull bussiness man, Tom, who does not have enough time for his family and
        almost forgets his daughters birthday. He also really hates cats, which is a shame, because his daughter has
        been wanting a cat for a really long time now. Tom gives in and buys a cat from a mysterious shop as a last
        minute gift, called Mr. Fuzzypants. The owner who is a peculiar character tells Tom that the cat has used 7 of
        it's 9 lives, but Tom just brushes it off. As Tom is driving home he visits his bussiness, which is bound to be
        the tallest building of North America. At the rooftop he gets into an argument, and as he is about to walk back
        lighting is struck. He falls of his building with the cat and is put in a deep coma. Only Tom's spirit isn't in
        his human self, it has transferred to the cat he recently got for his daughter. Nobody understand that Tom is a
        cat now, and the peculiar store owner from before tells him that he needs to reconnect with his family to be
        turned back into a human. His adventure contuines.<br> This movie has some good morals to think about, but it is
        also a funny movie you can laugh at from time to time. If you enjoyed this movie I reccomend watching <a
          href=#filmtape>Garfield</a></p>

      <h3>Cat</h3>
      <h4 class="dividers"> <em>Coraline (2009)</em></h4>
      <p> In this movie a young girl named Coraline has a hrd time adapting to her new home, as her parents never have
        any time for her because they are always too busy with work. She meets a neighbouring boy and a black cat. THe
        town is very eery as Coraline receives a doll tha is very similair to her that leads into a small door in her
        new house. As she enters, she suddenly is in a parallel universe, where her parents giv more attention to her,
        but their eyes are black buttons. Coraline likes this world more and decides to stay for a while. Some time
        later Coraline realises that yhis universe isn't as great as it seems to be, as her "Other" parents want to sew
        black buttons into her eyes. Horrified Coraline escapes, but keeps feeling drawn to the little door. The only
        thing that stays the same in both of the universes is the black cat. The blackcat advises Coraline to stay out
        of the door only to see her in the other universe again, being dissapointed.<br>
        This movie has a really spooky vibe to it and is great to watch during Halloween. This movie has alot of
        theories surrounded, which are very fun to explore. If you enjoyed this movie, I think <a href=#filmtape6>Kiki's
          delivery service</a> is a movie you might enjoy. They aren't really similar, but both stories include a black
        cat that gives the main character advice.</p>

      <h3>Catbus</h3>
      <h4 class="dividers"> <em>My Neighbor Totoro (1988)</em></h4>
      <p> My Neighbour Totoro is an Ghibli anime film that is about two young girls that have recently moved into an old
        house with their dad. Their mom has a terminal illness so they wanted to move into a house that is closer to the
        hospital, so they could spend more with her in her last moments. The house and the forest nearby posses alot of
        magical creatures, which the girls interact with. One day one of the girls goes out into the woods and meets a
        big fluffy beast, called Totoro. She falls asleep and seems to dream about planting trees with her sister, but
        when she wakes up in her own bed there is no trace of the trees whatsoever, only the seeds that have already
        sprouted. The girl is really sad that she can't show her sister Totoro, but she reassures her that he'll come
        back the next day. The next day as the girls wait for their bus on a rainy day, Totoro appears next to them.
        They wait a little longer untill Catbus arrives. Totoro boards it and the bus drives away, as the girls watch in
        amazement.<br> This is my favorite Ghibli film, so I reccomend this movie to everyone who likes anime and hasn't
        watched it yet. If you like this movie I also reccomend <a href=#filmtape6>Kiki's delivery service</a> as it is
        also a Ghibli movie and has the same vibe that Ghibli movies provide.</p>

      <h3>Jiji</h3>
      <h4 class="dividers"> <em>Kiki's delivery service (1989)</em></h4>
      <p> The main character in this movie is called Kiki, and she is getting ready to leave her house with her black
        cat Jiji. Jiji is a smart and sassy cat but has a really good bond with Kiki. Kiki is a witch and is destined to
        find a town and settle in as the local witch. She finds a town near the see and start living with a nice couple
        that owns a bakery, and opens Kiki's delivery service. She delivers baked goods but also presents on her broom
        on which she can breeze quickly through the town. After a delivery gone wrong and an awkward experience with a
        friend she likes, Kiki becomes depressed and cant understand Jiji anymore. Watch the movie to see how it ends!
        <br> Despite saying that <a href=#filmtape5>My Neighbour Totoro</a> is my favorite Ghibli film, this is a very
        close second. The music is phenomenal and has won multiple awards</p>
